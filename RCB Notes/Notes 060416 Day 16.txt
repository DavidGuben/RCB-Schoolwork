API / AJAX

AJAX BREAKDOWN
XML or JSON: the text-only format used to transfer data from server to browser script. 
Developers are increasingly using JSON over XML because of its native JavaScript compatibility.
CSS: the language used to style how the data will look onscreen
JavaScript: displays the data in the browser and processes user requests/interactions like clicks
XMLHttpRequest objects: the keystone of AJAX, they actually retrieve the data with the server behind the scenes. 
All modern browsers support XMLHttpRequests.

jQuery.ajax()

The XMLHttpRequest object is used to exchange data with a server.

syntax:
$.ajax ({
	//URL to where the request is sent
	url: '',
	//method for manipulating data
	method: 'GET/POST'

})

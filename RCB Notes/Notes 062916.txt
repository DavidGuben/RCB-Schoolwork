CONST DECELARATION:

SYNTAX
const name1 = value1 [, name2 = value2 [, ... [, nameN = valueN]]];

DESCRIPTION
The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value.
It does not mean the value it holds is immutable, just that
the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.


SPLIT DECLARATION:

SYNTAX
var str = "How are you doing today?";
var res = str.split(" ");

DESCRIPTION
The split() method is used to split a string into an array
of substrings, and returns the new array.

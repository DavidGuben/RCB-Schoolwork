API - app program interface
is a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications.
An API specifies how software components should interact and APIs are used when
programming graphical user interface (GUI) components.

A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks.

TYPES OF API
Most operating environments, such as MS-Windows, provide APIs, allowing programmers to write
applications consistent with the operating environment. Today, APIs are also specified by
websites. For example, Amazon or eBay APIs allow developers to use the existing retail
infrastructure to create specialized web stores. Third-party software developers also use
Web APIs to create software solutions for end-users

More generally, in object-oriented languages, an API usually includes a description of a
set of class definitions, with a set of behaviors associated with those classes. This 
abstract concept is associated with the real functionality exposed, or made available, 
by the classes that are implemented in terms of class methods (or more generally by 
all its public components hence all public methods, but also possibly including any internal 
entity made public like: fields, constants, nested objects, enums, etc.).

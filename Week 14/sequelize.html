* **Instructions:**

- Spend the next few ~15 minutes with your partner answering the following questions. You should be using the Sequelize Documentation (and whatever other references you find online).

	- Answer: What is Sequelize?
	it is a promise-based orm for node.js

	- Answer: What advantages does it offer?
	Basically Sequelize.js has good support for database synchronization, eager loading, associations, transactions and migrations.

	Another main advantage of Sequelize.js is it easy to test. we can use Mocha like frameworks to run tests. We can have two database one for tests and one for develop environments, as we will see in this article.

	- Answer: How do I install it? How do I incorporate it into my app?
	// INSTALL
	$ npm install --save sequelize
	# And one of the following:
	$ npm install --save pg pg-hstore
	$ npm install --save mysql
	$ npm install --save sqlite3
	$ npm install --save tedious // MSSQL

	// BASIC SETUP
	var sequelize = new Sequelize('database', 'username', 'password', {
  host: 'localhost',
  dialect: 'mysql'|'sqlite'|'postgres'|'mssql',

  pool: {
    max: 5,
    min: 0,
    idle: 10000
  },

  // SQLite only
  storage: 'path/to/database.sqlite'
});

// Or you can simply use a connection uri
var sequelize = new Sequelize('postgres://user:pass@example.com:5432/dbname');

	- Answer: What the heck is a Sequelize model? What role will it play?

	A Model represents a table in the database. Sometimes you might also see it referred to as model, or simply as factory. This class should not be instantiated directly, it is created using sequelize.define, and already created models can be loaded using sequelize.import

	- Answer: Let's say I have the below table in MySQL.

		| Country     | PhoneCode | Capital   | IndependenceYear |
		|-------------|-----------|-----------|------------------|
		| Afghanistan | 93        | Kabul     | 1919             |
		| Belarus     | 375       | Misk      | 1991             |
		| Netherlands | 31        | Amsterdam | 1648             |
		| Oman        | 968       | Muscat    | 1970             |
		| Zambia      | 260       | Lusaka    | 1964             |

		- How would I model it in Sequelize?

	var User = sequelize.define('user', {
  firstName: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING
  },
  lastName: {
    type: Sequelize.STRING
  }
	});

	// force: true will drop the table if it already exists
	User.sync({force: true}).then(function () {
	  // Table created
	  return User.create({
	    firstName: 'John',
	    lastName: 'Hancock'
	  });
	});

		- How would I query for all the records where the Independence Year was less than 50 years ago?
		

		- How would I query the table, order it by descending Independence Years, and limit the results to just show 2 of the records. Skipping the first two? (i.e. Results: Zambia, Afghanistan)

	- Bonus: What is umzug? How could I use umzug to create a table?

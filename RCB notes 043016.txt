CSS ELEMENTS

USEFUL ATTRIBUTES
display:none; - removes existence of object from the page

FLOAT
clear - clears the float so other elements after it won't get thrown out of the flow
of content.

POSITION
absolute - position according to the document
fixed - position according to the window
relative - position according to relative(nearby) elements

Body is static by default. If you create a relative element and create absolute elements
inside of it the elements will be absolute to the relative element.
